              <h3>Who We Are</h3>
              <p>We are creators, we are hustlers, we are artists, we are dancers - although for some of us the dancing is a work in progress.  At RBCA we are a team of passionate go-getters that take pride in the work that we create in order to help others whether that means a mobile app for a small business owner, a new website for a local animal shelter, or brand development for a multinational corporation.  We don't believe in standard 9-5's nor do we think that great work comes from the same cubicle in that same tired office day after month after year.  Come for the happy hours and team dinners, stay for the company retreats to the Virgin Islands and Lake Tahoe.  We are passionate about the work we get to do and the people we get to work with.  We're growing quickly, so if it sounds like you may be a good addition to our team then we can't wait to hear from you!</p>

                <p class="darkp">The opportunity to work for our clients is a priviledge that we don't take for granted.  From the first discovery meeting to the final project delivery we work very hard to provide world class services and produce industry leading results.  We welcome the challenges our clients present because we know that our work is not just clean designs and lines of code.  Our work helps support causes, grow businesses, and improve lives.  We believe that by surrounding ourselves with empathetic, driven people we can produce meaningful work that makes a difference.</p>

                <p class="darkp">The world would be a boring place if everyone was the same and so would our team.  We prioritize building a diverse team filled with different backgrounds, appearances, and beliefs.  <!--  Different experiences and perspectives help us solve the tough problems for clients and grow as individuals and as a team.  -->  This doesn't just apply to people; we believe in offering a variety of locations as well.  Even as a small team we keep offices in NYC, LA, British Columbia, and Birmingham.  We believe that having options is good for the soul and helps you produce your best work.  This is why we encourage activities like morning yoga on the beach or skiing powder laps on your lunch break - so team memebers can do what they love on a daily basis.  We believe that a fulfilling life produces great work - not the other way around.  Our team can work from any of our locations, hop between offices, or work remotely - or a combination of all three!</p>

We're proud of the work we have produced, but we value the idea that you can never be truly creatively satisfied.  We push each other, we compete, and we learn together to grow and always be improving so that our next project is always the best work that we've ever produced.  <blockquote>"Don't make a distinction between work and play.  Regard everything that you're doing as play, and don't regard for one minute that you have to be serious about it."</blockquote>  We didn't say that, <strong>Alan Watts</strong> said that, but we dig it!</p>
